## Project 3 - Emotion recognition

Team members: Bingqian Wu, Daniel Lee, Lulu Dong, Suzy Gao, Tushar Vijay Ponkshe

Summary: In this project, we developed a new method and improved the emotion classification accuracy for images of people to 47%.

[Contribution Statement] As a group, we chose which models to implement for the project. All team members contributed to the GitHub repository and prepared the presentation. All team members approve our work presented in our GitHub repository including this contribution statement.


Bingquan Wu: Write gbm baseline model, Naive Bayes and CNN model, helped with debug, translate 'feature.R' into python code.

Daniel Lee: Worked on organizing GitHub, Worked on baseline model, Convert R coding into python, calculate running costs(memory and time).

Tushar Ponkshe: Migrated R code to Python - set directories, read .mat files, created fiducial point list, train/test split, calculated running costs.

Suzy Gao: Built SVM and XGboost model, applied cross validation with gird search for parameter tuning, created PPT presentation slides.

Lulu Dong: Built Conv1d CNN model and did cross validation of XGboost to tune parameters. Evaluated different models and combined the codes.
